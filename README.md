# Coarse-grained Simulation using OpenMM
## Introduction 
- This project contains C++ code running coarse-grained model simulations based on OpenMM (http://openmm.org/). <br>
- Now it supports the Electrostatics Inclusive Karanicolas-Brooks (EIKB) G≈ç model (Karanicolas, John, and Charles L. Brooks III. Protein Science 11.10 (2002): 2351-2361.) <br>
- The main feature of this project is that it supports Hamiltonian replica exchange method with highly flexible Hamiltonian by utilizing the flexible OpenMM API.
