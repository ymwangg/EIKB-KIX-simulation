# Coarse-grained Simulation using OpenMM
This project contains C++ code running coarse-grained model simulations based on OpenMM (http://openmm.org/). <br>
Now it supports the Karanicolas-Brooks G≈ç model (Karanicolas, John, and Charles L. Brooks III. Protein Science 11.10 (2002): 2351-2361.) <br>
The main feature of this project is that it supports Hamiltonian replica exchange method with highly flexible Hamiltonian by utilizing the flexible OpenMM API.
